# mountaineersapp

This is an app for the board game "Mountaineers: A 3D Board Game" developed
by Massif Games LLC.

The goal is to create something that will be able to be used as both an Android and IOS app for
customers who own the game, Mountaineers. 

I'd like to increase the "intelligence" of the automated climbers to use "AI" in a sense. 


It's possible that python isn't the best thing to write this in... Not sure yet.
